        <p>Minimal single-page-application framework. It's primary focus is loading HTML/text 
            content and binding it to a HTML element while exposing event lifecycle hooks. It 
            includes a XHR utility for XMLHttpRequests and a Router utility for managing changes 
            to the window.location.hash.
        </p>
        <p>Its design focus is on keeping the developer grounded and connected to the page by staying 
            as minimal as possible. It only exposes a couple of functions and has almost no configuration 
            needed. It can be learned in an hour and mastered by the end of the day.
